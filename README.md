Kate is an average person who has accumulated a lot of stuff over the years. 

A large portion Kateâ€™s stuff is her clothing.

She has 25 jackets or coats, 20 bags, 50 bottoms (skirts, pants or jeans), 60 pairs of shoes, and 130 tops (shirts, sweaters, and t-shirts).

This is a combination formula:

Kate just wants to get dressed and start her day.

But the amount of unique combinations she can make with her items is

## 17 994 159 309

Kate wants to unsee this number. 
She needs help.

Her better self comes to the rescue.

She studies SQL and creates a schema with 3 tables in it.

The largest table, articles_list, contains 16 fields, including:
- Article_ID (primary key)
- Subcategory_ID
- Brand_Name
- Weather
- Occasion
- Color
- Color_Family
- IsCurrent (boolean)
- IsOversized (boolean)
- NumTimes (the amount of times a particular item was chosen)
- NumYears (the amount of years Kate has the item)
- Style (example: "BFM" stands for "Bohemian," "Futuristic," and "Modern")

Kate creates an inner join of articles_list and article_category and saves the result as an csv file.

She parses the file in Python and makes 6 lists of lists.
