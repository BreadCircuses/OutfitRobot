# Superficial Robot

#### Superficial Robot reduces the time to make an everyday decision from 15 minutes to 3 seconds.
#### It solves the "I have nothing to wear" problem once and for all.
#### Written in Python.



Kate is an average person who has accumulated a lot of stuff over the years. 

A large portion Kateâ€™s stuff is her clothing.

She has 25 jackets or coats, 20 bags, 50 bottoms (skirts, pants or jeans), 60 pairs of shoes, and 130 tops (shirts, sweaters, and t-shirts).

This is a combination formula:

Kate just wants to get dressed and start her day.

But the amount of unique combinations she can make with her items is

n!/r!(n-r)! = 295!/5!(295-5)! = 295!/5!*290! = 1.302405364 E+602/120*6.031611618 E+589 =

## 17 994 159 309

Kate would rather unsee this number. 
She needs help.

Her better self comes to the rescue.

She studies SQL and creates a schema with 3 tables in it.

The largest table, articles_list, contains 16 fields, including:
- Article_ID (primary key)
- Subcategory_ID
- Brand_Name
- Weather
- Occasion_Name (example: "BCD", "BD", "C," where "B" stands for "Business," "C" for Casual," and "D" for Dressy")
- Color
- Color_Family
- IsCurrent (boolean)
- IsOversized (boolean)
- NumTimes (the amount of times a particular item was chosen)
- NumYears (the amount of years Kate has the item)
- Style (example: "BFM" stands for "Bohemian," "Futuristic," and "Modern")

Kate quiries her database and begins to realize what causes her problems.

 ```
SELECT outfit_robot.articles_list.Weather,
COUNT(Article_ID) AS Num_Warm
FROM outfit_robot.articles_list
WHERE Weather = "WRM";
 
 ```
Result = 62, or 26% (there are 238 records in the articles_list database). 

26% of Kate's clothing is only suitable for very warm  weather, while the proportion of really warm days in SF (according to Kate's definition of "warm" and given that she lives in the Sunset) is about 5%.

```

SELECT outfit_robot.articles_list.Occasion_Name,
COUNT(Article_ID) AS Num_Formal
FROM outfit_robot.articles_list
WHERE Occasion_Name like "%D%";

```
The result of 191 means that 80% of Kate's items are somewhat formal (and she tries to avoid them).

A couple more quiries confirms Kate's hypothesis that she wears only a small fraction of the items she owns.

```
SELECT outfit_robot.articles_list.num_times,
COUNT(Article_ID) AS Max_Num
FROM outfit_robot.articles_list
WHERE num_times > 20;

```
Result = 14. The proportion of items Kate wore more than 20 times is only 6%.

```

SELECT outfit_robot.articles_list.num_times,
COUNT(Article_ID) AS Min_Num
FROM outfit_robot.articles_list
WHERE num_times <= 3;

```
Result = 116. The proportion of items Kate wore 3 times or less (including never) is 49%.

Kate decides to do the following:

1. Stop buying new clothing
2. Stop thinking about her existing clothing
3. Spend no more than 2 minutes a day to get dressed
4. Write an algorithm that makes it all possible

She creates an inner join of articles_list and article_category and saves the result as an csv file.

Parses the file in Python and makes 6 lists of lists.

*the code works and accomplishes the goal. the readme describing the algorithm is to be continued*
